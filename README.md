The free RoboRemote IR Dongle protocol lets you send IR commands to any previous generation WowWee robots. These dongles come for free in the [RoboSapien X](http://store.wowwee.com/robots/robosapien-x.html) or [RoboRaptor X](http://store.wowwee.com/robots/roboraptor-x.html) products. Or else they can be purchased seperately from our [online store](http://store.wowwee.com/robots/roboremote.html).

How to use it
-----------------------------------------------

Using this SDK is very simple, each sound file available corresponds to a different button on the corresponding robot remote control.

All you need to do is play the sound file within your application making sure that the device has atleast 75% volume (this varies on each device). This will transmit the correct IR signal from the remote dongle

Licensing
-----------------------------------------------
Any apps developed using these sounds that are designed for the WowWee RoboRemote IR dongle can be released without restriction on any app store. No royalties are required.

We do however ask that you provide a link to our online shop so that customers can purchase the robots if they don't already have one.'
